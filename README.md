## What Movie Should I Watch Next?
A web application to help users quickly find movies or tv shows to watch. Deployed at: https://what-movie-should-i-watch-next.herokuapp.com

## Motivation
Current streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video give us instant access to thousands of movies and tv shows like never before. However, the abundance of selections often prove to be a hindrance when it comes to actually choosing a movie to watch. We may spend lots of time looking through IMDb for a perfect movie, but in the end, realize that it is not available on the streaming services that we own. We can also look for a movie by scrolling through each streaming service individually, but that often proves to be an endless, time-consuming task.

With this project, my plan is to help solve this issue by allowing users to search for movies based off of filters such as available streaming services, genre, year released, etc. This will hopefully narrow down the selections that people have and allow them to quickly choose something to watch.
